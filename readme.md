# Myntra Project â€“ E-commerce Web App

I developed a Myntra Clone using React.js, Redux, Node.js, and Express to create a seamless e-commerce experience. This project replicates key features of Myntra, including product listings, add-to-cart functionality, and price calculations.

## Frontend (React & Redux)
The frontend is built with React.js, making the user interface dynamic and interactive. Redux handles state management, ensuring a smooth shopping experience. Users can browse products, view discounts, and add or remove items from their cart efficiently.

## Backend (Node.js & Express)
The backend, built with Node.js and Express, manages product data, user authentication, and cart operations. I implemented RESTful APIs to fetch product details and handle cart interactions in real time.

# Key Features
Product Listings: Displays various products with images, descriptions, ratings, and prices.
Add to Bag & Remove from Bag: Users can add products to their shopping bag and remove them easily.
Discounts & Offers: Displays original and discounted prices with percentage calculations
